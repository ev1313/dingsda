class Union(Construct):
    r"""
    Treats the same data as multiple constructs (similar to C union) so you can look at the data in multiple views. Fields are usually named (so parsed values are inserted into dictionary under same name).

    Parses subcons in sequence, and reverts the stream back to original position after each subcon. Afterwards, advances the stream by selected subcon. Builds from first subcon that has a matching key in given dict. Size is undefined (because parsefrom is not used for building).

    This class does context nesting, meaning its members are given access to a new dictionary where the "_" entry points to the outer context. When parsing, each member gets parsed and subcon parse return value is inserted into context under matching key only if the member was named. When building, the matching entry gets inserted into context before subcon gets build, and if subcon build returns a new value (not None) that gets replaced in the context.

    This class exposes subcons as attributes. You can refer to subcons that were inlined (and therefore do not exist as variable in the namespace) by accessing the struct attributes, under same name. Also note that compiler does not support this feature. See examples.

    This class exposes subcons in the context. You can refer to subcons that were inlined (and therefore do not exist as variable in the namespace) within other inlined fields using the context. Note that you need to use a lambda (`this` expression is not supported). Also note that compiler does not support this feature. See examples.

    .. warning:: If you skip `parsefrom` parameter then stream will be left back at starting offset, not seeked to any common denominator.

    :param parsefrom: how to leave stream after parsing, can be integer index or string name selecting a subcon, or None (leaves stream at initial offset, the default), or context lambda
    :param \*subcons: Construct instances, list of members, some can be anonymous
    :param \*\*subconskw: Construct instances, list of members (requires Python 3.6)

    :raises StreamError: requested reading negative amount, could not read enough bytes, requested writing different amount than actual data, or could not write all bytes
    :raises StreamError: stream is not seekable and tellable
    :raises UnionError: selector does not match any subcon, or dict given to build does not contain any keys matching any subcon
    :raises IndexError: selector does not match any subcon
    :raises KeyError: selector does not match any subcon

    Can propagate any exception from the lambda, possibly non-ConstructError.

    Example::

        >>> d = Union(0,
        ...     "raw" / Bytes(8),
        ...     "ints" / Int32ub[2],
        ...     "shorts" / Int16ub[4],
        ...     "chars" / Byte[8],
        ... )
        >>> d.parse(b"12345678")
        Container(raw=b'12345678', ints=[825373492, 892745528], shorts=[12594, 13108, 13622, 14136], chars=[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56])
        >>> d.build(dict(chars=range(8)))
        b'\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07'

        >>> d = Union(None,
        ...     "animal" / Enum(Byte, giraffe=1),
        ... )
        >>> d.animal.giraffe
        'giraffe'
        >>> d = Union(None,
        ...     "chars" / Byte[4],
        ...     "data" / Bytes(lambda this: this._subcons.chars.sizeof()),
        ... )
        >>> d.parse(b"\x01\x02\x03\x04")
        Container(chars=[1, 2, 3, 4], data=b'\x01\x02\x03\x04')

        Alternative syntax, but requires Python 3.6 or any PyPy:
        >>> Union(0, raw=Bytes(8), ints=Int32ub[2], shorts=Int16ub[4], chars=Byte[8])
